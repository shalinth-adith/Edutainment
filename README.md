Edutainment Multiplication Game – SwiftUI App for Kids

An interactive learning app designed for kids to practice multiplication tables in a fun and engaging way. Built using SwiftUI, the app combines education and entertainment (edutainment!) to make math enjoyable for children aged 6–9.

Features :

 Select multiplication range (e.g. up to 5, 8, or 12 tables) 
 Choose number of questions: 5, 10, or 20 
 Randomly generated multiplication questions 
 Score tracking and feedback after each game 
 Restart game from toolbar 
 Clean, colorful, and kid-friendly UI
 Input answers using a number-only TextField

Educational Focus :

This app was built with educational goals first, making it ideal for:

Early learners mastering basic multiplication
Quick math drills for classroom or home
Parents looking for screen time that teaches

What I Learned :

Conditional views using @State and view switching
Creating custom data models (Question struct)
Random number generation and logic-based UI
Passing closures between views
Toolbar buttons and text field styling
Basic game state management

Tech Stack :

 Language: Swift
 Framework: SwiftUI

 Device Support: iPhone / iPad

Ideas for Future Enhancements :

 Fun animations for correct/incorrect answers
 Voice or audio feedback for accessibility
